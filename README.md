# All Who Wander
A simple top-down adventure game with a retro 8 bit aesthetic. Built in the spirit of Breath of the Wild, this game will emphasize
exploration of an open world, and an engaging real-time combat system. Augmenting this game
experience will be an ample amount of loot, environmental features and scenery to explore,
and auxiliary mechanics such as a crafting system and a leveling system.
  
This project’s minimum viable product would see no more than a small gameworld in
which the player’s character could move around, strike at endlessly spawning enemies, and pick
up and use simple items. Further enhancement would see the addition of more items and
enemy types, and a larger gameworld. Ideally, procedural generation might be used to
create and populate the gameworld.

### Demographics
Our target audience is the retro and indie game market. This market is motivated
by nostalgia, and by a desire for exposure to simple games which require little emotional
investment. Our game’s main point of attractiveness would be novelty, and second to this, its
open world and exploration based (as opposed to story or combat-system based)
gameplay experience.


### Key Features
- An open world, populated with a sufficient number of game entities.
- Real time combat system involving a mix of melee and ranged weapons
- Animations of game entities via sprite transitions.
- Basic character controls.
- Loot system, allowing users to pick up items
- A player resource management system

#### Additional Features
- Multiple types of enemy.
- Items and magic spells.
- A leveling system.
- A crafting system

### Scaling
There are many opportunities for upscaling. Denser population of the game world with
entities, and more nuanced game world generation would be key. The addition of more
weapons, castable magic spells (offensive and defensive), and more items would be another
avenue for expansion.


### Risks and Problems 
- Downscaling from the minimum viable product would be difficult. A game is an
interconnected system. The minimum viable product specified above (a simple gameworld,
player movement, a single type of enemy spawned, and a single weapon used in combat) is the
minimum number of components required for a game such as this to be considered remotely
complete.
- Implementation of the interconnected-world-model, and of the view, and the communication between the two is complex. 

### Technologies
- Unity is the engine/framework being used for this project
