Contained within this document is a written summary, for clarity and posterity, of the streamlined testing procedures to be employed to ensure functionality of the project. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">These procedures will be divided by category (domain of function) and then subdivided into unitary subsections. Each test will outline the initial state required for the test, the sequence of actions to be performed by the developer to perform the test, and the expected output.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><h1 class="c9"><span class="c13">Player Controls</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Player controls are the scripts which translate input from the user into action by the player entity within the gameworld. Actions include movement, the execution of attacks using various weapons, and the triggering of an &ldquo;interaction&rdquo; event with other gameworld objects. Many such actions trigger corresponding animation sequences in addition to their primary effects.<br><br>Thus, to &ldquo;test&rdquo; a player control means ensuring an input is properly triggering some primary action and its accompanying animation. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Some actions have conditions placed upon them (another object must be in range, etc.) and some actions can only be performed whilst the player in a specific state (a player cannot attack with two weapons at once).<br><br>Therefore, some additional measures are required to ensure that input only maps to actions when those actions are valid.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c2"><span class="c8">Movement</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Movement occurs when the player uses the joystick or arrow keys on the keyboard. Movement causes the player&rsquo;s position to change, and the camera to follow the player. While moving, the player enters a &ldquo;walking&rdquo; animation state, and is displayed accordingly. Movement cannot occur if the player is an attacking state. Though the player has 360 degrees of freedom in which to move, they can only face in one of the four cardinal directions at once.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Initial Conditions </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Idle in the center of an empty space.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Actions and Observations</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Press and hold for 1 second each of the four arrow keys, in sequence. The player should move without encumberment in each of the corresponding directions. The player should enter into a walking animation state for each, facing the right direction.<br><br>Press and hold for 1 second each pair of arrow keys, in sequence. If the two arrows correspond to diagonal movement, the player should move diagonally. When moving diagonally, they should face in the corresponding </span><img src="images/image1.png"><span class="c3">-axis direction. If the two arrows are in opposition, then the player should not move and be in an idle animation state.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Press and hold for 1 second each triplet of arrow keys. In any triplet of keys, to keys should be in opposition. Thus, the player should move and be facing the unopposed direction.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Press and hold for 1 second all four arrow keys. The player should not move and should be in the idle animation state.<br></span></p><h2 class="c2"><span class="c8">Movement with Shield</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The player may walk whilst holding out their shield. The mechanics of this are identical to movement without a shield, except movement speed should be reduced.<br><br></span><span class="c10">Initial Conditions </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Idle in the center of an empty space.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Actions and Observations</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Perform each of the tests outlined in the subsection above (&ldquo;Movement&rdquo;) whilst also holding either of the &ldquo;shift&rdquo; keys. The results should be the same as in the tests above, except that the player&rsquo;s shield should be visible.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c2"><span class="c8">(Not) Walking through Solid Objects</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Most objects as well as many environmental features in the game are impassable. When movement in any direction would cause the player to collider with such an impassable entity, the player&rsquo;s and their movement through the world should cease. The player&rsquo;s animation state should remain in walking-state and facing the appropriate direction.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>An effect known as &ldquo;sliding&rdquo; occurs when the player has both </span><img src="images/image1.png"><span>- and </span><img src="images/image2.png"><span class="c3">- axis movement at once, and movement is incumbered on one of these two axes. When this occurs, movement in the unincumbered direction is executed, and movement in the other direction is ignored. Animation should remain in walking state as though it were unincumbered. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Initial Conditions </span></p><p class="c0"><span>Idle in the center of a square of impassable objects such as walls (exactly five tiles wide and tall). <br><br></span><span class="c10">Actions and Observations</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Move in each of the four directions in sequence. The player should move and be animated accordingly in each direction. When the player encounters the wall their movement should end, though their walking-state animation should continue as normal.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Move back to the center of the square.<br><br>Move directly up until the player encounters the wall. Then, move both up and to the left. The player should move to the left, sliding along the wall. Repeat this process for each of the diagonal directions. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c2"><span class="c8">Attack Execution</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The player can attack with four different weapons: a sword, a spear, a bow and arrow, and a magic spell. The player can also &ldquo;interact&rdquo; with another object, which invokes similar machinery though without an animation. Each action is mapped to a specific and constant key. <br><br>Once triggered, each attack executes a 1-second animation. Attacks can be triggered in (can face in) each of the four directions. Attacks can be triggered whilst walking with or without a shield but cannot be triggered whilst another action is being executed. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Initial Conditions</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Idle in the center of an empty space.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Actions and Observations</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Whilst idle, strike each action key (giving each enough time for one to finish before striking the next). An animation should play for each. For spells and arrows, a projectile should be fired.<br><br>Add a &ldquo;Debug.Log&rdquo; statement to the method associated with each action key, within the conditional to indicate that the action is being executed. Strike each pair of actions in quick succession. The first action should fire and be visible in the console, but the second should not. If this is the case, then actions are not executing whilst other actions are in progress.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c2"><span class="c8">Projectiles</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Projectiles are independent game objects spawned by long-range player attacks. These objects move in a straight line until they encounter another solid object and are then destroyed. If the solid object is an enemy or the player (if the projectile was spawned by the player or an enemy, respectively) then damage is dealt to the collided with entity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Magic spells have the secondary effect of triggering a flashy animation if they collider with an enemy.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Initial Conditions</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Idle in the center of a square of impassable objects such as walls (exactly five tiles wide and tall).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Actions and Observations</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Face in each direction and strike the bow-and-arrow key for each. An arrow should shoot from the player, collide with the wall, and vanish. Do the same for the magic-spell and observe the same results.<br><br>Remove the walls, and instead, place an enemy directly in-front of the player with its motion toggled off.<br><br>Fire an arrow at the enemy. It should enter the recoiled animation state, indicating that damage has been dealt.<br><br>Fire a spell at the enemy. A secondary, flash animation should engulf the enemy for 1 second, and then disappear. The enemy should then enter the recoil animation state.</span></p><h1 class="c9"><span class="c13">Enemy and NPC AI</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Enemies and NPCs are controlled by an artificial intelligence which commands their movement, their tracking towards the player, and their attacks. NPCs and enemies in their &ldquo;idle&rdquo; states will choose a random direction to move in, move for 1 second, and then stop and idle for 1 second (then repeat this sequence). When the player gets within a certain range of an enemy, the enemy will attempt to move towards the player and then attack. If the player leaves this range, the enemy will return to its idle state.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c2"><span class="c8">Enemy and NPC Patrolling</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Enemies and NPCs engage in patrolling behaviour. When patrolling, these entities will choose a random cardinal direction and move in that direction for 1 second. They will then stand idle for 1 second, before repeating this cycle.<br><br></span><span class="c10">Initial Conditions</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Spawn an enemy directly in the center of an empty space.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Actions and Observations</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Observe the entity. The entity should move in some direction, stop, and then move again in some direction.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c2"><span class="c8">Chasing</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Enemies will, when the player gets within chase range, attempt to move towards the player and then attack the player. Since enemies must face the player direction along the </span><img src="images/image1.png"><span>-axis, enemies will actually move towards the space directly in front or behind the player (on the </span><img src="images/image1.png"><span class="c3">-axis).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Initial Conditions</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Spawn the player and an enemy across from each other on the </span><img src="images/image1.png"><span class="c3">-axis, with the player to the left of the enemy and with a reasonable amount of space between then. Toggle off roaming behaviour.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Actions and Observations</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Walk the player directly towards the enemy. The enemy should walk directly towards the player and then stop when it is just in-front of the player. If the player leaves chase range, the enemy should return to its roaming state.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Respawn the enemy and the player in the appropriate positions as to perform the same test as above, but with the enemy approaching from each of the 7 other directions (3 cardinal, 4 diagonal). In each test, the enemy should start moving towards the player as the player enters chase range, stop when they are directly in front of the player on the </span><img src="images/image1.png"><span class="c3">-axis, and then attack.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Reset the player and enemy to the first test state. Move the player to within chase and range and observe that the enemy begins to chase the player. Quickly move away from the enemy and observe that the enemy stops chasing.</span></p><h1 class="c9"><span class="c13">Registering Attacks and Damage</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Damage is dealt from one party to another when an attack is triggered by one party, and another party is within attack range (and is directly in front of the attacker). Once one party has been attacked, it is invulnerable for 1 second. The player does not have a recoil animation, but enemies do. When an enemy is dealt damage, it enters into its recoil animation and is invulnerable for 1 second. The enemy then returns to either its idle, chasing, or attacking state.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c2"><span class="c8">Player Attacking Enemies</span></h2><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Initial Conditions</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Spawn an enemy directly in front of the player, and toggle off its attack behaviour. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Actions and Observations</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Repeatedly strike the player&rsquo;s various attacks. For each attack, the enemy should enter into its recoil state. After 1 second, the enemy should exit its recoil state. Continue attacking, repeating this cycle. Eventually, the enemy should despawn, having been destroyed.</span></p><h2 class="c2"><span class="c8">Enemy Attacking Player</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Enemies attacking the player works exactly like the opposite, except enemies have a 1 second cooldown after their attack animation ends. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Initial Conditions</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Spawn an enemy directly in front of the player, and toggle on its attack behaviour. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Actions and Observations</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Stand idle, allowing the enemy to repeatedly attack the player. Enemies should attack, stand idle for 1 second, and then attack again. Eventually, the player should despawn, having been destroyed.</span></p><h1 class="c9"><span class="c13">Spawning</span></h1><p class="c0"><span>The spawning system is responsible for systematically repopulating the world with enemies. The spawning system is embodied by &ldquo;spawn points&rdquo; placed manually throughout the world. Each spawn point will, at the start of the game, spawn an enemy near to it. Whenever the enemy is destroyed, the spawn point registers this and becomes primed to spawn a new enemy. Once the spawn point is further than a minimum distance from the player (is off screen, more or less) it will respawn its enemy.<br><br></span><span class="c10">Initial Conditions</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Place a spawn point somewhere on the screen. Also, place the player somewhere on the screen.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Actions and Observations</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Start the game. An enemy should appear near the spawn point. Defeat the enemy. Walk in any direction until the spawn point is off screen. Walk back to the spawn point. A new enemy should have appeared.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><h1 class="c9"><span class="c13">Items</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In game items are GameObjects with unique sprites and interactions based on their specific role within the game. Items are tested in the pocket versions of the game with the items placed &ldquo;by hand&rdquo; in the situations listed below. An items functionality and expected outputs are compared using in game interfaces, as well as console logs. An item is first tested under normal situations, once this is passed further tests are completed. Items can be interacted with using two different methods: player collision or user hotkey - these are referenced as trigger styles below.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><ol class="c17 lst-kix_list_3-0 start" start="1"><li class="c0 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Item placed alone and interacted with. </span></li><li class="c0 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Two identical items place on top of each other.</span></li><li class="c0 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Two different items with the same trigger style placed on top of each other. </span></li><li class="c0 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Two items with different trigger styles placed on top of each other. </span></li><li class="c0 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Items spawn at Player position. </span></li><li class="c0 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Items spawn at Enemy position.</span></li></ol><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><h1 class="c9"><span class="c13">Looting</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The loot system relies on a GameObject which holds references to different loot items in the game. When an enemy dies it instantiates one of these items at random using the product of a random number generator and the enemy&rsquo;s level. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Initial testing includes controlled situations of enemy death and observing the item output. Additionally, the value of the &ldquo;loot roll&rdquo; is displayed within the console so it can be checked against the expected output. Once this is confirmed additional testing follows. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Simulation of large amounts of enemy deaths are done within Unity&rsquo;s game world, with large quantities of enemies dying after a set amount of time. The appropriate rate of loot dropped is checked against expected results. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><h1 class="c9"><span class="c13">Leveling</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c3">A player level is gained when the player has collected experience points up to the next milestone amount. Once a level is gained, permanent changes happen to the players stats and a new milestone amount is set. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">To test the levelling system intractable objects are placed in a line in front of the player object evenly spaced out. Each item gives enough experience points to progress the player to the next level in the system. Once interacted with the items destroy themselves.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Initial testing follows the sequential order of items, checking at each one if the player level is gained and if the appropriate stat changes are implemented using Unity&rsquo;s built-in object inspector. Additional testing takes uses the items in a random order to determine if the same level is reached as the initial test, and if any changes are seen in the player stats at each level. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><h1 class="c9"><span class="c16">User Interfaces</span></h1><p class="c5"><span>The general outline of each user interface contained in all who wander can be tested upon the initial startup of a new game even if it is the first execution of the build. Specific functionality may require minimal setup. Because of the graphical nature of the user interfaces, only manual testing will be performed. Very literal &lsquo;visual verification&rsquo; will be performed for most of the UI testing where success is determined by physically observing the outcome of the actions of interactable UI elements and UI rendering. </span></p><h2 class="c14" id="h.zet8bst500ls"><span class="c11">Start Screen</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c3">The first screen displayed when executing a build of the game.

Then once the settings screen is visible, click each button and verify that its callback function works as intended. The call backs will be related to actual game settings like sound, resolution, and difficulty (time dependent), and one callback will be to close the settings screen. These settings will all have to be verified manually by the user that is testing (Play sound and see if the volume slider functions, change resolution and see if the screen changes, etc).</span></p><h2 class="c14" id="h.hxstuk7ir1gq"><span class="c11">Overlay Screen</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c3">Displayed concurrently with the active game.
